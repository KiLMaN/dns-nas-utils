This is a small set of tools for making your D-Link NAS do it's thing.
Supports at least the DNS-320 and DNS-325

Installing
==========

Until I get around to adding it to an apt repository, it can be installed
thus::

  wget https://github.com/lentinj/dns-nas-utils/raw/master/dns-nas-utils.deb
  dpkg -i dns-nas-utils.deb

Temperature
===========

Reads temperature (either via. I2C or ttyS1) and returns in degC. For example::

  # dns_temp
  38

Fan Control
===========

A small shell-based daemon to control the fan based on NAS temperature. In
theory it can measure temperature of HDDs too, however hddtemp counts as
activity as far as the HDDs are concerned, so won't spin down.

Building package
================

Can be done with this command::

  gzip -9c changelog > dns-nas-utils/usr/share/doc/dns-nas-utils/changelog.gz
  fakeroot dpkg-deb --build dns-nas-utils
